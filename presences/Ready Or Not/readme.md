This presence uses Steam.
If your Steam profile is set to private, it won't detect the game correctly.

If Rich Presence Plus cannot retrieve your Steam ID automatically, you need to manually assign your ID as follows:

1. Navigate to the presence folder.

2. Create a .env file.

3. Inside the file, paste the following:

```
STEAM_ID=your_steam_id
```
Replace **your_steam_id** with your actual Steam ID.
